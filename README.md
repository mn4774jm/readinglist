## Book Reading List

The Book Reading List program allows for users to store a list of books
in a SQLite database that includes the books title, author's name, and a status of either 
'read' or 'not read'.

For ease of organization the program allows for the user through a simple menu to accomplish the following:
* Add new books to the database
* Search for specific entries by partial authors or titles
* Review stored books all together or by read/unread status independently
* Change the 'read' status of existing entries
* Delete old entries by the books assigned ID number

Uses SQLite3 database to store data. 

Requires Python 3.7.
